Hi there 👋, My name is Ruhul Amin Parvez. A self-taught, passionate, and fast-learner Python Django developer from Dhaka, 🇧🇩. Now I'm a final year student of undergrad Computer Science and Engineering. <br>

I have a burning desire to put together well-written code that helps to create advanced applications which are fit for purpose, functionally correct, and meets the user’s precise needs. I've got a track record of using modern technologies to bring software products to life. <br>

My key strengths include being able to use web-based systems that create a highly interactive user experience. On a personal level, I'm loaded with energy and passion. Right now I would like to join a company where there is a culture of encouragement, respect and teamwork.
